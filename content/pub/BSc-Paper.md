"An introduction to bitcoin and blockchain: A computer science and economical approach (Based on Iran financial crisis)" is my BSc project. In this work, I've reviewed bitcoin from both an economic and technical perspective. The first section shows why bitcoin can be used as a valuable commodity especially in countries dealing with financial problems. After that, It reviews some important parts of blockchain technology for whoever wants to start learning the technical aspect of it. Finally, I referenced readers to some valuable resources for further reading.
