Hey there! My name is Mikaeel and I am a computer science and software engineer enthusiast. My main (in no specific order) interests are:
- Networks
- Robust and optimized software development
- Blockchain Technology and decentralized systems
- Linux and open-source software

In my spare time, I play games, read some books, and participate in teaching and learning in my subjects of interest. My CV is attached [here](https://mikaeelmayeli.com/pdf/CV.pdf).

I am not much of a writer but I will try to explain topics that I find interesting in this blog.

If you need to contact me you can do so by emailing me at mikaeelmayeli [at] Gmail [dot] com.
